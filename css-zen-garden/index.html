        <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
        <p>
          Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of
          browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
          abandoned browsers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been
          achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP,
          and the major browser creators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
          lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
          time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one
          with the web.
        </p>
        <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
        <p>
          There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden
          aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view
          some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will
          load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same,
          the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext
          document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets
          people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the
          reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from
          structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty
          of the web; we can always push it further.

        <h3>Participation</h3>
        <p>
          Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
          page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but the example files
          are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as
          starting points. Please see the CSS Resource Guide for advanced
          tutorials and tips on working with CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML.
          This may seem daunting at first if you've never worked this way
          before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample
          files as a guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you
          have completed your masterpiece (and please, don't submit
          half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your
          control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all associated
          assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on
          our server.
        </p>

        <h3>Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can
          all refer to showing people how amazing CSS really can be. This site
          serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today,
          learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future
          techniques we can all look forward to.

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>
          Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4
          should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong
          fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional,
          practical CSS and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2%
          of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your
          CSS validates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
          implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see
          fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the
          sheer number of user agents on the web these days especially when you
          factor in mobile pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
          every platform. That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your
          design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox,
          iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
        </p>
        <p>
          We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright
          laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to
          incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're
          well past the point of needing another garden-related design.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain
          full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see
          submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a
          Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so that
          others may learn from your work.
